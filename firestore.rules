/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model combined with a database-backed administrative role. 
 * Users have full control over their own data subtree (profile, knowledge, chat logs), but cannot access, list, or even 
 * know about the data of other users. A separate 'roles_admin' collection grants read-only administrative access across
 * the entire user data structure for moderation and support purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure: All user-specific data is hierarchically nested under the /users/{userId} path, providing strong
 * structural separation. A top-level collection, /roles_admin, explicitly defines which users have administrative privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All access is denied by default. Rules explicitly grant permissions.
 * - Strict Ownership: All user-generated content is locked to the owner's UID.
 * - Admin Read-Only Access: Admins can read any user's data but cannot write, update, or delete it, preventing impersonation or accidental modification.
 * - No User Listing: Users cannot query the top-level '/users' collection, enhancing privacy.
 * - Secure Admin Management: The '/roles_admin' collection is not writable by any client-side rule, preventing privilege escalation. Admins must be managed server-side or via the Firebase Console.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: To ensure fast and simple rules, authorization data is denormalized. For example, 
 * a 'knowledge' document under a user's path contains an 'authorId'. The rules enforce on creation that this 'authorId' 
 * matches the user's ID from the path, creating a secure and immutable link that doesn't require slow cross-document lookups.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The use of a nested structure like /users/{userId}/knowledge/{knowledgeId} is a powerful form
 * of segregation. It guarantees that queries for a user's knowledge entries can never accidentally leak data from another user.
