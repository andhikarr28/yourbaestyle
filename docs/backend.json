    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure is designed to support the YourbAIstyle application, focusing on secure access control, efficient data retrieval, and scalability. It leverages path-based ownership for user-specific data and a global roles collection for administrative privileges. Authorization Independence is achieved by storing the `authorId` within each Knowledge document, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to a parent user document to determine ownership. QAPs (Rules are not Filters) is achieved because all entities within a collection share the same security posture. For example, only the owner can read/write data in the `/users/{userId}/knowledge/{knowledgeId}` collection. The structure uses explicit state modeling is used for the User `role` field (DBAC - Database Auth over Claims). The absence of a membership model is due to there being no collaborative entities."
